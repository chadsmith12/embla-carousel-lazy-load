# Embla Carousel Lazy Load Demo

This demo shows an implementation of lazy loading on a carousel using the [Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com/). This demo uses the embla-carousel-vue component wrapper. The main inspiration and source of this demo was from the React Version located [here](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/embla-carousel-lazy-load-react-xgnzq8?file=%2Fsrc%2Fjs%2FEmblaCarousel.tsx%3A44%2C22). This demo was converted to Vue 3 and uses Typescript.

## Running Demo

Running the demo is simple. First install the dependencies using `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed then run the demo using `npm run dev`.

There is a small `setTimeout` right before new images are loaded just to demonstrate that the images are actually lazy loaded. Iamges aren't loaded are really just a transparent placeholder image being shown right now.
